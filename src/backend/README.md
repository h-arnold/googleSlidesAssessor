# New Backend

As langflow seems to break new things with each update and the LLM 'flows' are relatively straightforward, I had the mad idea of just coding a new backend from scratch jusing Node and Langchain. As I'm unlikely to have time to work on this any time soon, it may never be implemented but I've saved the spec and implementation plan that ChatGPT and I came up with to refer back to should I, or someone else decide to pick this up in the future.
