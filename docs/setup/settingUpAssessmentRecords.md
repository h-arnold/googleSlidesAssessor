### ❗ Important Note

For testing purposes, you only need to make a copy of the template file once and find the `CourseID` (the unique identifier for a Google Classroom class). Place it in cell `B2` on the `ClassInfo` sheet.

---

#### 📂 Copying the template files

1. Make a copy of the template files from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/16DcR-0sXJQasrX6kjw-l9F-1evMFT8fk).

2. Move those files to wherever you want to store them in Google Drive. In this example, we've created a folder called **Classroom Assessment Records**.

   **💡 Tip:** Double-check the root of your drive if you cannot find the files.

5. You will be prompted to authorise the script. You only need to do this once.

   **⚠️ Note:** After authorisation, repeat the previous step.

6. The script will populate the Google Sheet with all your Google Classrooms.

   **💡 Tip:** At the start of the year, you can get the script to create all your Google Classrooms by filling in the required details. **Teacher 1** will be the main teacher of the class.
